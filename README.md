# Final Examination Schedule - Fall 2008 (Internship Project)

This project is part of my internship with **Innomatics Research Labs**. The goal was to create an exact replica of a **Final Examination Schedule** table for Fall 2008. 
The table includes exam timings for various courses, organized from Monday, Dec 15 to Thursday, Dec 18, with a special "HOME" section/column.

## Objective

The task was to replicate a given table structure with precise attention to layout, styling, and visual presentation using basic web technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the table.
- **CSS**: For styling the table (borders, colors, padding, etc.), including an external CSS file for simplicity.
  
### Key Features
- A header that spans all columns with the exam schedule title.
- Specific background colors for headers, time slots, and the "HOME" section.
- Four exam days with four slots per day, covering multiple courses.
